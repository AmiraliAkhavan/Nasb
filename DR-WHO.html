            This series is about a space traveler who travels through time and is known as "The Doctor". It is interesting to know that Doctor Who is rarely used as a character's name during different episodes of the series and is usually only used in the end credits.

 

The Doctor is a member of a race of aliens called the Time Lords who hail from a planet called Gallifrey. Most of the time lords follow certain rules and regulations, and one of their policies is not to interfere in world events. However, the doctor is a rebel character who deliberately enters history to fight evils and help the oppressed.
